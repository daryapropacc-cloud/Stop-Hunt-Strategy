# Stop-Hunt-Strategy

A crypto-first Python project to design, backtest, and evaluate trading strategies with robust performance and risk metrics.

## Current status

This repository now includes a production-oriented architecture scaffold so we can implement your strategy rules next.

## Next step

Share your detailed stop-hunt strategy rules (entry, exit, stop, target, filters, timeframe, symbols), and I will implement them into this architecture and set up the first full backtest report.
## Data sourcing review

A detailed review of options to collect 1H OHLCV data for the top 50 crypto assets is available in `docs/DATA_SOURCES_REVIEW.md`.


## Fetch CoinMarketCap OHLCV (Daily + 1H)

This project includes a script to pull the last 3 years of OHLCV for:
- `#btcusdt.p`
- `#ethusdt.p`
- `#solusdt.p`
- `#xrpusdt.p`
- `#dogeusdt.p`

Using CoinMarketCap (mapped by base symbols BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP/DOGE):

```bash
export CMC_API_KEY="<your_api_key>"
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/fetch_cmc_ohlcv.py --years 3 --output-dir data/raw/cmc
```

Output files are written as parquet files like:
- `data/raw/cmc/btc_daily.parquet`
- `data/raw/cmc/btc_hourly.parquet`

## Notebook: Data exploration

For visual exploration with a TradingView-like interactive candlestick style (Plotly dark theme):

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb
```

The notebook expects cached parquet files in `data/cmc/` generated by:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/fetch_cmc_ohlcv.py --years 3 --output-dir data/cmc
```
